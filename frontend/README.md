Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Run dev server:

   npm run dev

Notes: Tailwind requires PostCSS and the Tailwind plugin. The package.json includes Tailwind as a dependency but you may need to run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` during development if not configured.
