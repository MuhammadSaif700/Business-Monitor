# üîí SECURITY NOTICE - PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Change These Before Going Live

Your application is currently configured with **placeholder security credentials**. 
You MUST change these before deploying to production:

### 1. Backend API Key (Required)
**Current:** `YOUR_SECURE_API_KEY_CHANGE_THIS`  
**Action:** Generate a secure random key

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Update in `backend/.env`:
```
BACKEND_API_KEY=your_generated_key_here
```

### 2. Backend Password (Required)
**Current:** `YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD_CHANGE_THIS`  
**Action:** Choose a strong password

Update in `backend/.env`:
```
BACKEND_PASSWORD=your_strong_password_here
```

### 3. Google AI API Key (Required for AI features)
**Current:** Working demo key (but you should use your own)  
**Action:** Get your own key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

Update in `backend/.env`:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

## ‚úÖ Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Changed `BACKEND_API_KEY` from placeholder
- [ ] Changed `BACKEND_PASSWORD` from placeholder  
- [ ] Obtained your own `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=false` in `.env`
- [ ] Updated `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for your domain
- [ ] Enabled HTTPS/SSL for your domain
- [ ] Tested login with new credentials
- [ ] Backed up database
- [ ] Reviewed and understood all environment variables

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They're in `.gitignore` for a reason
2. **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Change API keys every 90 days
4. **Use HTTPS only** - Never deploy without SSL certificate
5. **Monitor access logs** - Watch for suspicious activity
6. **Backup regularly** - Schedule automatic database backups
7. **Update dependencies** - Keep all packages up to date
